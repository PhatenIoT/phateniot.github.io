It is an indispensable part of the process from design to mass production for Matter devices. Every mass-produced Matter device requires a DAC to comply with the requirements of the CSA Connected Home over IP Alliance.</p> <p>Matter adopts a security model based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The role of DAC is to convince the Matter network that the accessing device is a certified and trusted device. By tracing the certificate chain of the device DAC, users can verify whether the purchased Matter device indeed originates from the manufacturer indicated on the device packaging, thus avoiding inclusion of insecure devices. This certificate mechanism ensures the security of the Matter network and addresses the pain points of inadequate link security in smart home systems. In the absence of DAC, device manufacturers, even if they pass Matter certification, cannot complete the mass production and shipment of Matter devices. Therefore, while DAC benefits the Matter ecosystem, it also increases production thresholds and costs for manufacturers to a certain extent.</p> <p>As a Matter solution provider, Feiteng Cloud deeply understands the importance of DAC in the mass production of Matter devices.</p> <p>Currently, Feiteng Cloud can provide complete DAC services for manufacturers in the testing and production stages, helping them address urgent needs. Furthermore, for manufacturers who have already chosen Feiteng Cloud's Matter all-in-one solutions, Feiteng Cloud can also provide supporting production tools to facilitate scaled production.</p> <p>Matter, as a unified application standard, already has over 500 companies as Matter members, bringing not only standardized execution standards but also significant business opportunities.

This can result in failed flashing or complete corruption of the flash memory. Use a separate 3.3V power supply to provide more power, or use an adapter with a better power supply. Make sure you use the same GND wire for all DC voltages.</li> <li>Recheck your serial programmer to make sure it is supplying 3.3V and not 5V. 5V can damage the ESP chip!</li> <li>Release the GPIO0 button/wire before booting is complete - It is safe to connect GPIO0 to GND throughout the programming process (erase and upload). Just be sure to remove the GPIO0 to GND bridge before booting the device for normal operation.</li> <li>Make sure that the RX pin is connected to the TX pin between the serial adapter and the ESP device and vice versa. Note: Some devices may mark the TX and RX pins as opposite. In this case, connect the TX of the adapter to the TX and the RX to the RX pin.</li> <li>Before uploading the Tasmota firmware binaries, erase the flash memory and reboot the power supply.

It consists of a high-performance MCU called Real-M300 (Armv8-M, or KM4, compatible with the Rortex-M33 instruction set) followed by a low-power microcontroller (Rortex-M23 instruction set compatible) called RealM200 (or KM0 followed by the KM0), a WLAN (802.11 a/b/g/n) MAC, a WLAN (802.11 a/b/g/n) MAC with a 1T1R-capable WLAN baseband, RF, Bluetooth, and peripherals. </p> <p>A high-speed connectivity port, SDIO port, and USB port are also provided. There are also audio codecs, key scanning and touch keys integrated into this IC. In addition, the flexible design allows the GPIOs to be configured for different functions depending on the application.</p> <p> The W5B03A-1720DFV1 also integrates memory (ROM/SRAM/PSRAM) for IoT (Internet of Things) Wi-Fi protocol functions and applications. Customers are supported with user-friendly development kits (SDK and HDK) to develop IoT applications. </p> <p>The KM4 MCU is a 32-bit core that provides system enhancements such as low power consumption, enhanced debugging features, floating-point computing, DSP instructions, and a high level of support for block integration.The KM4 MCU contains a 3-level pipeline.</p> <p> The KM0 coprocessor is an energy-efficient, easy-to-use 32-bit core that is compatible with the code and tools of the KM4 core.The KM0 coprocessor provides up to 20MHz performance with a simple instruction set and reduced code size. </p>"},{"location":"products/8720df/#3-system-architecture","title":"3 System Architecture","text":"<p> In the W5B03A-1720DFV1, the master system consists of a 32-bit multilayer AXI bus matrix that interconnects all master and slave lines. The bus matrix provides master-to-slave access, enabling parallel access and efficient operation even when multiple high-speed peripherals are operating simultaneously. </p> <p>The multi-layer AXI bus matrix connects the CPU bus and other bus masters to peripherals in a flexible way that optimizes performance by allowing different bus masters to simultaneously access peripherals on different slave ports of the matrix.</p> <p> APB peripherals are connected to the AXI bus matrix via APB buses from the AXI bus ports of the multilayer AXI bus matrix. This reduces conflicts between the CPU and the DMA controller, and also allows peripherals on asynchronous bridges to have fixed clocks that do not track the system clock. </p>"},{"location":"products/8720df/#4-module-introduction","title":"4 Module Introduction","text":"<p>Click to view W5B03A-1720DFV1 Module introduction</p>"},{"location":"products/8720df/#5-product-documentation","title":"5 Product Documentation","text":"<p>Click to download W5B03A-1720DFV1 module Datasheet</p>"},{"location":"products/8720df/#6-buy-links","title":"6 Buy Links","text":"<p>Click to buy W5B03A-1720DFV1 Module</p>"},{"location":"products/8720df/W5B03A-1720DFV1/","title":"W5B03A-1720DFV1 Module","text":""},{"location":"products/8720df/W5B03A-1720DFV1/#1-product-description","title":"1 Product Description","text":"<p>W5B03A-1720DFV1-1624 (hereinafter referred to as W5B03A) is a module based on the Realtek highly integrated chip RTL8720DF, which supports WLAN dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) and low-power Bluetooth 5.0.
